# Feature Scoping Guide

Feature scoping is a phase in the development process where you prioritize and decide which features to include in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and which to consider for future development (stretch goals).

## Steps to Write a Feature Scope:

### 1. **List All Possible Features**:
   - Brainstorm all potential features for your application.

### 2. **Prioritize**:
   - Rank features based on core functionality, user value, and development time.

### 3. **Define Your MVP**:
   - Select essential features for launch.

### 4. **Stretch Goals**:
   - List features for future implementation.

### 5. **Document and Share**:
   - Clearly document and share your feature scope for feedback.

### 6. **Iterate**:
   - Adjust your scope as needed during development.
