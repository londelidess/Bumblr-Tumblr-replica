Flask/ React/ Redux/ sqlAlchemy/ postgreSQL/ AWS S3

## Development Challenges:

- **Media Upload and Post Creation**: 
  - **Redux**: Maintaining the state of the media being uploaded, especially when dealing with multiple file uploads, and reflecting that in the global state was a challenge.
  - **Flask Integration**: Making sure that the uploaded files are processed and stored correctly on the Flask backend.
  - **Error Handling**: Providing clear error messages to the user in cases of failed uploads or unsupported file formats.
